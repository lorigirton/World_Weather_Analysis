# World_Weather_Analysis

This project looks at what the weather is like as we approch the equator. The .gitignore file was used to prevent the API keys located in the api_keys.py file from being shared with the public. This project was broken into two parts and I chose to focus on part 1: WeatherPy. I created a Python script to analyze the weather from over 500 cities with differing distances from the equater. I utized the OpenWeatherMap API along with citipy Python library. I created scatter plots to showcase the relationships between Latitude vs. Temperature, Latitude vs. Humidity, Latitude vs. Cloudiness, and Latitude vs. Wind Speed. I then created the linear regression for each relationship for the Nothern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere and analyzed the relationships below each regression plot. 

This project is part of the UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp. I utized tutor sessions, AskBCS learning assistants, and ChatGPT to complete the project.
